# Ultra fast ONT basecaller

This is a very fast basecaseller which can basecall reads as fast as they come
from MinION on ordinary laptop.
There is also GPU version of basecaller, which (soon) will be as good as Guppy
and **does not** require compute capability 6.2 (anything which can run Pytorch 1.0 is good enough).

Also contains bigger network, which has performance similar to Guppy.

If you find this work useful, please cite (there will be preprint about his updates coming soon):

## Limitations

* Works only on 64bit linux.
* Only R9.4.1 for now.
* On AMD CPUs it is advised to use: `export MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5`
* You need python3 (tested with python 3.6)

## Instalation

* [optional] If you want to use GPU, we recommend setting up Conda environment with pytorch first.
* Install Rust (programming language, not game and besides you should already have it ;) )
* Ask for nightly version `rustup default nightly-2019-12-11`
* Clone this repository
* Run `python setup.py`
* Change Rust version to whatever you like

## Running

`deepnano2_caller.py --output out.fasta --directory reads_directory/`

For more accurate (but much slower) basecalling run:
`deepnano2_caller.py --output out.fasta --directory reads_directory/ --threads 16 --network-type accurate`

GPU caller:
`deepnano2_caller_gpu.py --output out.fasta --directory reads_directory/`

If you have new GPU (like RTX series) this might be faster:
`deepnano2_caller_gpu.py --output out.fasta --directory reads_directory/ --half --batch-size 2048`

## Benchmarks

Run on subset of 476 reads from [Klebsiela dataset](https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison/tree/95bf07476f61cda79e6971f20f48c6ac83e634b3).
MinION produces this amount in apx. 52 seconds assuming maximum throughput of 2M signals/s (which in reality never
happens, so realistic number is around 70 seconds).
